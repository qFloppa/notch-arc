"""Deploy Notch, to studionet or to the public testnet.

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe deploy/deploy.py                      # studionet
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe deploy/deploy.py --network bradbury    # testnet

**studionet** is the demo network. It is gasless, so this mints two fresh
identities and funds them via `sim_fundAccount` (the dispute bond is real
attached value even where gas is free), then prints the three lines to paste into
`.env`. Re-running deploys a *fresh* contract with fresh keys — deliberate,
because a demo wants a clean precedent corpus, and reusing a contract whose tab
ids are taken fails on `tab exists`. Pass `--keep-keys` to redeploy against the
existing identities instead.

**bradbury / asimov** is the "runs on a real network" deployment of spec §8. Gas
is real there, so nothing is minted or funded: it signs with the pre-funded
`BRADBURY_KEY` from `.env` and refuses to try if the balance is zero. No demo
identities are created, because the agents run on studionet.

Note the two testnet names are **the same chain**: both report id 4221 and return
an identical block hash at the same height, so deploying to one is deploying to
both.
