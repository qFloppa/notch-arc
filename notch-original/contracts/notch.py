    Declared as an EVM interface purely to reach its `emit_transfer`, which is
    `EthSend` with **empty calldata** — no method is ever called on it, hence the
    empty `View` and `Write`. This is not `gl.get_contract_at(...)`, and the
    difference is load-bearing rather than stylistic.

    `gl.get_contract_at(eoa).emit_transfer(...)` was the plan's line and it is
    **disproven**: on studionet the emitted child transaction fails with
    `Contract 0x... not found` — a `PostMessage` recipient must be a deployed
    contract — and the value is **not refunded**, so the bond is destroyed. A
    winner here is an agent's own account, so that path burns the money it is
    supposed to pay out.

    `EthSend` succeeds against the same address, and it resolves *synchronously*.
    That is the property `withdraw()` relies on: a failure raises inside the
    call and reverts the credit zeroing with it, so the ledger and the coin can
    never disagree. It either pays or it reverts.

    What is **not** proven: that the recipient's balance actually rises. Neither
    instrument studionet offers can show it — `eth_getBalance` reads 0 for every
    address including the one paying for deploys, and `wasi.get_balance` on
    another address crashes the call. The evidence is asymmetric rather than
    complete: the `PostMessage` path failed loudly and this one did not fail at
    all. Recorded here so nobody reads this as verified delivery.

        Needs no replay guard of its own, unlike `_settle_bond`: `already settled`
        above is a reachable, tested refusal on this statement's own status, and
        status is exactly what this reads. A second filing cannot get here.

        Only `s.accepted_by` is credited, and that is a security property
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        Nothing in this contract requires a party's consent to be *named* in a
        tab. `open_tab` takes a member list and validates its shape, not its
        agreement; `add_notch` puts no ceiling on `atto`; any member may `close`;
        and a lapsed window auto-accepts under §4. So without this restriction a
        stranger could open a tab naming a victim, bill them any amount, close,
        wait out the window, file a receipt, and write an arbitrary `cleared_atto`
        onto an address that never made a single call — a forged credit rating,
        cross-tab and permanent, since nothing here ever decrements. That was
        reproduced, not theorised.

        `accept` is the one affirmative signal that exists: it refuses the closer
        (§4 makes acceptance the *counterparty's* act), so an attacker cannot
        supply it for a victim, and it cannot be forged from a second address the
        attacker controls because only a debtor's own acceptance books that
        debtor's history. Hence: credit the accepter, if the accepter owes
        something on this statement, and nobody otherwise.

        The cost is real and is the reason this is a narrowing rather than a pure
        win: a statement that settles by silence builds no credit history for
        anyone. Silence is enough to make the netting binding, which is what §4
        asks of it — it is not enough to build a reputation, which is what §3
        asks of this. The alternative is opt-in tab membership, a much larger
        change to the tab model itself.

        Consequences worth knowing before trusting a number from here
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        1. **A disputed statement books nothing, for anybody.** `accept` requires
           `status == open` and `open_dispute` moves the status off it, so a
           statement that went to judgment can never have been accepted. A cycle
           that had to be adjudicated is therefore not a clean settlement in
           either direction — which also removes the incentive inversion a review
           found here: booking the *billed* leg amount would otherwise credit a
           payer in full for a bill an `upheld` verdict excused them from, making
           "be billed large and win" the cheapest way to raise a limit.
        2. **A statement netted to exactly zero books nothing either.** `close()`
           drops any pair whose signed total is 0, while its `nothing to close`
           guard counts *notches*, so `A` billing `B` 1000 and `B` billing `A`
           1000 produces a legitimate statement with no legs at all. There is no
           volume to clear, so there is nothing to credit.
        3. **`cleared_atto` is still only volume *claimed*.** §6 keeps obligations
           off-chain and `settle_ref` is an unvalidated reference, so the contract
           cannot verify that anything was actually paid. What this map now means
           is "volume on statements this address agreed to", which is as strong a
           claim as the design permits.
