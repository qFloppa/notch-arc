"""resolve(): the one nondeterministic method, and the checks that come first.

Evidence that does not match its committed hash needs no judge. The cheap
attacks — bill for work never done, bill and then delete the receipt — are
defeated by sha256 alone, deterministically, which keeps consensus off the LLM
wherever it can be kept off. So every short-circuit test here mocks a model
that would rule the *other* way: a check that failed to fire then shows up as
the wrong outcome, rather than as a test that quietly passes anyway.
