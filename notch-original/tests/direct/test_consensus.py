"""The equivalence rule: what a validator accepts from a leader.

Direct mode does not run validators as part of a contract call — but
`direct_vm.run_validator()` reaches the captured `validator_fn` afterwards, and
the validator re-runs `leader_fn` against the *current* mocks. So swapping a mock
between `resolve()` and `run_validator()` simulates a validator that saw
different external data, which is the only way to test the rule cheaply.

Two toolchain facts these tests are built on, both verified rather than assumed:

- `run_validator(leader_result=X)` wraps `X` as `gl.vm.Return(calldata=X)`;
  with no arguments it replays the real stored leader result. So the no-argument
  form is leader-versus-itself, the case that must agree.
- `run_validator(leader_error=E)` wraps as `UserError(message=str(E))`, and
  `UserError.__str__` is `repr`. Passing a `gl.vm.UserError` would therefore
  produce the message `"UserError(message='[TRANSIENT] …')"`, which starts with
  no prefix at all and would make a correct rule look broken. Every test here
  passes a plain `Exception`, whose `str()` is the bare message.

Task 8 runs the same rule against GLSim with real validators. These tests are
faster and cover more branches; that one proves the harness is not the thing
making them pass.
