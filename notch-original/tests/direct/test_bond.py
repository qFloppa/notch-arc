"""The bond: who wins it, and how they get it out.

Spec §6 splits settlement in two. `resolve` decides the winner and credits an
internal ledger; `withdraw` is a separate call the winner makes later. Nothing
outbound happens inside `resolve`, so a failed transfer can never wedge a
verdict — which is the whole reason the ledger exists rather than a direct send.

What direct mode can and cannot prove here
------------------------------------------
It proves the ledger: who is credited, how much, and that a credit can be spent
exactly once. It cannot prove the transfer, and the reason is worth stating
because it is not a limitation of these tests so much as of the harness.

`withdraw` pays through `_Payee(...).emit_transfer(...)`, which is `EthSend`.
Direct mode's `gl_call` has no `EthSend` branch and no cross-contract hook
installed, so the call is a **silent no-op** — verified by running it, not
assumed. That is convenient (the ledger half is testable with no shim) and it is
also a trap: a test asserting only that `withdraw()` did not raise would pass
against a contract that never sends anything. So every test below asserts the
*credit*, and the transfer is proven separately in `tests/integration/`.

The same no-op holds for the emitted-message API, which is how the plan's
original `gl.get_contract_at(who).emit_transfer(...)` survived to be written
down at all: on a real network it fails against an EOA with
`Contract 0x... not found` and does **not** refund, destroying the bond. Direct
mode is silent about that. See `_Payee` in the contract.
