# which kills every `direct_deploy` before the contract is even imported. The
# `os.dup2(fd, 0)` on line 291 has already succeeded by then, so swallowing the
# error leaves a fully working VM. No-op on POSIX.
#
# ponytail: this leaks one temp file into %TEMP% per contract call on Windows.
# Delete this whole block once gltest's own `finally:` tolerates the failed
# unlink — still identical in 0.29.2 and 0.30.0rc2, so check
# gltest/direct/loader.py:293 before assuming it is fixed.

# patches in `activate`) while leaving `gl.message_raw["datetime"]` frozen at
# deploy time, and no contract reading canonical block time can observe time
# passing.
