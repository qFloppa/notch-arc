"""Validator agreement under real consensus, on a network the tests do not mock.

What this file adds over `tests/direct/test_consensus.py`
--------------------------------------------------------
Direct mode replays a captured `validator_fn` in-process: one node, one
interpreter, mocked web and LLM, `run_nondet_unsafe` patched to a plain call. It
proves the equivalence *rule* is right. It cannot prove the rule survives a real
network, because nothing there crosses a sub-VM boundary or runs two nodes.

These tests run on studionet: five hosted validators, real HTTP fetches of
evidence committed to this repo, and a real model for the one scenario that needs
one. Together they answer the question direct mode structurally cannot — does the
leader's verdict actually carry a validator quorum.

Reading a receipt correctly
---------------------------
`ACCEPTED`/`FINALIZED` are lifecycle states, not success. A reverted call
finalizes too, with `execution_result: ERROR` and no state change — and every
validator votes `agree` on that error, so a vote count alone looks healthy. This
was not theoretical here: a Windows-only bug in the local simulator produced
exactly that shape (five agreeing votes, FINALIZED, no state written), and only
`tx_execution_succeeded` told them apart. Every write below asserts it, and the
state assertions that follow are the real proof.

Evidence must be byte-stable or the hash check is meaningless
------------------------------------------------------------
`GOOD_URL` pins a **commit SHA**, never a branch: a branch URL would serve
whatever the file becomes, and the committed hash would drift out from under the
test. `.gitattributes` marks `fixtures/** -text`, so git rewrites no byte of it in
either direction, and the sha256 below was verified against a live fetch of that
exact URL — 200, 142 bytes, identical digest.
