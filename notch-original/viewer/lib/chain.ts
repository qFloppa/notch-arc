/**
 * Server-side chain access. Nothing in here may be imported by a client
 * component — it reads the two signing keys.
 *
 * Everything below was established by probing the live contract with
 * genlayer-js 1.1.8, not from the library's types or its docs. The four that
 * changed the code:
 *
 * 1. **The receipt is snake_case.** `status_name`, `result_name`,
 *    `consensus_data`, `leader_receipt` — all snake_case on studionet, while
 *    `statusName` and `txExecutionResultName` exist only in the type
 *    declaration and read `undefined` at runtime. 1.1.8 exports no
 *    `isSuccessful`, so `succeeded()` below is ours, mirroring
 *    `agents/common.succeeded()`.
 * 2. **`readContract` changes a field's type by magnitude.** It defaults
 *    `jsonSafeReturn: true`, which maps a bigint to a `number` at or under
 *    9007199254740991 and to a decimal `string` above it. Measured on one
 *    statement: `get_notch(...).atto` came back a number, `legs[0].atto` a
 *    string. So every amount crosses this boundary as a string and is parsed
 *    with `BigInt`.
 * 3. **`client.fundAccount` does not work here.** Its guard is
 *    `chain.id !== localnet.id`, and in genlayer-js `localnet.id` is 61127
 *    against studionet's 61999 — unlike genlayer-py, where both are 61999 and
 *    the same call goes through. The underlying `sim_fundAccount` RPC works
 *    fine when issued directly, and credits immediately.
 * 4. **`getTransactionQueuePosition` throws** `Function "queues" not found on
 *    ABI` against studionet's deployed consensus contract. So there is no queue
 *    position to show; "submitted, awaiting consensus" is the honest state.

 * declares `atto: u256` crashes the GenVM with `exit_code 1` and a Python
