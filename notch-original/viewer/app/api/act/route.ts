/**
 * POST /api/act — the relayer.
 *
 * Submits and returns a transaction hash. It never waits for consensus: a
 * `resolve` measured 141s and then 26s on the same path and ~250s elsewhere,
 * against Vercel Hobby's 300s function cap, so waiting here would be a coin flip
 * on the demo's most important screen. The client polls `/api/tx`.
 *
 * Validation lives in `lib/ops.ts`, which is the trust boundary — see its header
 * for why the operation set is closed and why no address or amount is accepted
 * from a client.
